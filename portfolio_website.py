        Here is more info about Steve: 

        His full name is Steve Healey. He is a Services and Sales Executive in the field of document management and intelligent information.
        He is a Drone enthusiast and has a website www.thedroneimages.com where you can see some of
        his cool Drone photography (see photos below). He is really into Raspberry Pi's and a Pi running a Skycam 
        on his roof to capture the stars, a Pi running led lights on the front of his house that dance to music, 
        and a Pi controlling a Telescope and Mount for astrophotography. 
        He obtained his bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science from Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston MA. He also later studied Project Management
        at Northeastern University. He dabbles with Python and OpenCV (see video below) and has programmed Drones
        to fly autonomously. He has a favorite Drone called the DJI Air 3. He lives north of 
        Boston MA, USA. He age is between 50 and 65 years old. He has the mind of a 30 year old in a slightly older body. 
        He has blue eyes, which is his favorite color. He weighs just under 175 lbs. He started 
        riding a bicycle this year and absolutely loves it. He road the bike over 60 miles last week.
