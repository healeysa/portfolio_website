        Here is more info about Steve: 

        Steve Healey is a Services and Sales Executive in the field of document and intelligent information management.
        He is also a Drone enthusiast and has a website www.thedroneimages.com where you can see some of
        his cool Drone photography (see photos below). Steve is really into Raspberry Pi's and a Pi running a Skycam 
        on his roof to capture the stars, a Pi running led lights on the front of his house that dance to music, 
        and a Pi controlling a Telescope and Mount for astrophotography. Steve obtained his bachelorâ€™s degree in 
        computer science from Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston MA. He also later studied Project Management
        at Northeastern University. Steve also dabbles with Pyhon and OpenCV (see video below) and has programmed Drones
        for autonomous flights.
